// This is some old code I was trying to use to avoid using HTML
// However, I've since learned HTML and will use it for this module. 
// // ChatGPT told me this is an important line to set up so that Node.js
// // can get user input. It's like setting up an input() function
// const readline = require("readline");

// // ChatGPT also told me this creates an input/output interface using the 
// // readline we just created. 
// // This will let me get my user input lol
// const rl = readline.createInterface({
//     input: process.stdin,
//     output: process.stdout
// });
