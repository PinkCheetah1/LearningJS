|Did you implement the entire set of unique requirements asdescribed in the Module Description document in I-Learn? |No|I started the project with Node.js but found it was taking so much time to integrate that I chose to move to HTML and focus the rest of my time learning JavaScript rather than trying to make Node.js the center of the project.|

### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
Having a simple theme that I could build off of (i.e., retreive a number and do math to it) was very helpful for giving me something I could explore and practice with. 
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
In the future, I plan to use more tutorials, since hopping between information pages without gaining a solid understanding of the program made learning difficult. 
- How can you improve in the next module?
I can improve by finding good tutorials and sources of solid overviews that I can use to start off on the module.
