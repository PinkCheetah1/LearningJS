[-] Learn some HTML ;-; - DO THIS LATER
[] Make project plan 
[] Download HTML CSS stuff and Extensions 
[] See about doing HTML and CSS as a module for this class
[] See about maybe learning React as a module? 

Things to learn: 
[X] Variables (let, const, var)
[X] Data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)
[X] Operators (+, -, *, /, ===, &&, ||)
[X] Conditionals (if, else, switch)

Plan: Learn About Number app
Base app: 
    [] User enters number and program prints number back
    [] App tells user what numbers app is divisible by
    [] Tell user if it is a prime number 
Stretch goals:
    [] Tell user what prime number is closest
    [] Give user prime factor code :D 


NOTES FOR REFERENCE: 

data types:
    - String
    - Number - both int and float - can use exp. notation
    - Bigint - beeg number 
    - Boolean
    - Undefined - both value and type
    - Null
    - Symbol
    - Object - Arrays, Object (dictionary)
    use typeof to figure this out in debugging



How to use arrow functions:

    [functionName] = function() {
        return [returnWhatever]
    }

could become...

    [functionName] = () => {
        return [returnWhatever]
    }

could become... (if only one line of code, and returns the product of that line)

    [functionName] = ([whateverInput]) => [whateverCode];

^ this returns the product of [whateverCode]

You can call any of these with functionName() and it will return returnWhatever
