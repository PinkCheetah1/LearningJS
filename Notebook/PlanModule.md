### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

NOTE: I am behind, so I'm only planning for one week so I can get caught up <3

### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
Not doing things when I'm supposed to

##### Action Plan
Block out that time in my calendar and make sure I know where I'm going to be when I do it. 
If I can't do it at that exact time, I'll move the hour block in my calendar so I still get it done. 

#### Risk 2
I'll under or overestimate what I can get done in this space of time

##### Action Plan
Create lots of stretch goals and keep an open list of things I can do in my program. 
I'll learn the bare minimum before doing too much and get an idea of what I want to be doing. 
Work on one stretch at a time to keep working till I've reached a good stopping point by the end.
